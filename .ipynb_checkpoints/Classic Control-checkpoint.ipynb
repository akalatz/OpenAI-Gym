    "The CartPole is a very simple and classic example of a reinforcement learning problem first described by Sutton, Barto, and Anderson [Barto83]. From the OpenAI Gym website, \"A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The system is controlled by applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart. The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over. A reward of +1 is provided for every timestep that the pole remains upright. The episode ends when the pole is more than 15 degrees from vertical, or the cart moves more than 2.4 units from the center.\""

    "Essentially all of the greedy actions are action 0. Why is this? Obviously always moving left is not ideal. Well, the issue stems from the fact that I have continuous data. For example, say 0.00101 and 0.0010100001 are unique, even though in this instance they should be considered equivalent compound this with the fact that there are four values that make up a state means we will **very** rarely encounter a state twice. Action 0 is greater because when a action is selected as the argmax between two of the same actions, it just chooses the first occurence of it, in this case action 0. We need to fix our representations of the state by turning out continuous data into discrete ones, by creating bins for each continuous value to fall into to. Then which 4 bins, for the 4 different values, are selected represent the state. This will allow each bin to be visited more often, and fix the oversight"
